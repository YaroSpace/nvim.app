This catalog of Neovim plugins and Neovim related projects is my way to express gratitude and appreciation to the Neovim community.

The data is collected from [Awesome Neovim](https://github.com/rockerBOO/awesome-neovim) and searched in **GitHub** for topics `neovim, plugin; nvim, plugin; neovim-plugin; nvim-plugin`, so some users' configs may also end up in the catalog.

## API

Plugin data is available as JSON from:

```
https://nvim.app/repos-page?
  &q=search_string
  &group=group_name
  &sort=sort_name
  &category=category_name
  &limit=results_per_page
  &page=page_no
```

Request headers should contain: **Accept: application/json**
